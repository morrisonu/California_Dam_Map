# Dams in California by County and Assessed by Condition
Urijah Morrison

## Introduction
This map represents the locations of all dams in   California that are under the jurisdiction of the Division of Safety of Dams (DOSD). These dams are then labeled by the current condition of the dam after being assessed, with the three conditions being: satisfactory, fair or poor. It also functions as a chloropleth map through showing a range of the number of dams in each county through
variations in the shading of the county polygons. The map uses sequential data and shows the shading of the polygons ranges from light to dark (low to high).

## Major Functions
* Popup and symbol displaying the condition assessment of the dam
* County polygons shaded by the number of dams in the county
